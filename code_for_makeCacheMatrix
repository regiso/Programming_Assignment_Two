#programming assignment 2

# create a a variable to store the cachematrix function
# that will make it easier to use in the cacheSolve part of the exercise
a<-makeCacheMatrix()

# store a matrix that will be  used in a subset of the a variable - the set function at the beginning

a$set(matrix(1:4, 2,2))

#Define the cachematrix function as a function that stores functions

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x=matrix()) {
	m<-NULL						#initialize a null matrix
	set <- function(y) {				#set y equal to the input (i.e. x)
		x <<- y					#make x to y in the cache space
		m <<-	NULL				#m is set to null in the cache space
	}
	get <- function() x				#get that returns x
	setmatrix <- function(solve) m<<-solve		#setsolve creates a solve matrix to m
	getmatrix <- function() m			#getsolve returns m
	list(set=set, get=get, 				#creates list of the functions included in makeCacheMatrix
		setmatrix=setmatrix,
		getmatrix=getmatrix)
}

 
#this code checks to see if the matrix has been inverted
#if inverted already it pulls it from the cache
#otherwise it calculates the inverse and saves it

cacheSolve <- function(x=matrix(),...){			# assigns function performed on matrix  to catchSolve	
	m <- x$getmatrix()				#assigns m to get a the getmatrix subset of x
	if(!is.null(m)) {				#if m is not null then it will got to cache to get m
		message("getting cached data")
		return (m)
	}
	matrix <- x$get()				#if m is NULL then it fills data with the get subset of x
	m <- solve(matrix,...)				#then m is filled with the solve of x
	x$setmatrix(m)					#then it puts this into setmatrix subset of x
	m						#returns m as the solve of x
